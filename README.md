# CrisprX
This is a simple project using sequential machine learning algorithms to investigate potential CRISPR sequences.

The code is done in Shanghai Sai-Long biotech.

The code looks good, however, the performance of crossing-dataset is not so good.

To run this, you will need some big files in datasets/ and genome/ trained_models/ folders, which are absent here. Contact jzhang71@ncsu.edu if you need them. Also. you will need to construct your own input/ and output/ folders.
